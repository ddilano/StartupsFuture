### Startup's Future
Startup's Future aims to find the likelihood of success of a certain startup. This was my first ever project I built on my own. As of my graduation from Grace Hopper, I've decided to put it on Github years later. Here are the steps followed in this project:
  - The projects uses Crunchbase Dataset. 
  - The data were first cleaned(removed faulty/incomlete) using Python, then divided into two as test(30%) and training(70%).
  - Using PyBrain library, a neural network nodes have been formed and used to observe the outcomes.
